To play chess, run the game.rb file.

You can change @player1 and @player2 in Game#initialize to be either a HumanPlayer or an AIPlayer.
Then you can play vs. the computer, or another person, or watch the computer play itself.

The cursor starts below the board so it won't be visible during AI vs. AI games.
If you are playing as a human player, simply press the up arrow once and it will enter the board and remain visible from then on.
